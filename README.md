# Unity-Platformer
Small Unity Game made for a 3rd semester class(Multimedia and Interfaces) competition. We took 3rd place out of ~160 people. It was made equally by me and 2 other students(ASarzyniak and SRak). Some of the assets were made by us, some of them were not. We took 4th place out of ~160 people.
